###Weather-Data-Analysis-in-JFK-Airport using R
Tasked to perform a high level analysis of weather data in JFK Airport in order to better understand the current and historical record of precipitations based on different variables and how it relates to the possibility to rain because it will affect flight delays, flight arrivals and etc. Various local climatological variables are used to predict the possibility of precipitations including temperature, wind speed, humidity, dew point, and pressure. In this project, I performed numerous tasks including reading data files, preprocessing data, creating models, improving models and evaluating them to ultimately choose the best model using a number of R packages such as tidyverse and ggplot2.
